### 2.2. Layered Breakdown

#### 2.2.1. Data Ingestion Layer
**Purpose**: Responsible for collecting real-time and historical market data from the LBank exchange.
**Key Components**:
- **`lbank_connector.py`**: This module is the primary interface for interacting with LBank's API. It utilizes the `ccxt` library to handle:
    - **Historical Data**: Fetches historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data for backtesting and initial model training.
    - **Real-time Data Streams**: Establishes WebSocket connections to stream live kline (candlestick), trade, and order book depth data. This data is then published to Kafka topics for further processing.
- **Kafka Producer**: Integrates with Kafka to ensure efficient and scalable streaming of raw market data.

#### 2.2.2. Data Processing & Feature Engineering Layer
**Purpose**: Transforms raw market data into actionable features for the DRL models and other system components.
**Key Components**:
- **`feature_engineer.py`**: Consumes raw data from Kafka, calculates a wide array of technical indicators (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands) and other market features (e.g., volatility, liquidity, order book imbalance) using libraries like `pandas-ta`.
- **`data_storage.py`**: Manages the storage of processed data and features. It primarily uses:
    - **InfluxDB**: For storing time-series data (OHLCV, technical indicators) for quick retrieval and analysis.
    - **Feature Store**: A local or distributed storage solution for managing and versioning features used in ML model training and inference.
- **Kafka Consumer/Producer**: Consumes raw data and publishes processed features back to Kafka, enabling a stream-processing pipeline.

#### 2.2.3. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) Core Layer
**Purpose**: Houses the intelligence of the trading agent, responsible for learning and generating trading signals.
**Key Components**:
- **`trading_environment.py`**: Defines a custom Gymnasium (formerly OpenAI Gym) environment that simulates the LBank trading environment. This environment interacts with historical and real-time market data, executes simulated trades, and provides rewards/penalties to the DRL agent based on its actions and portfolio performance. It's crucial for training and evaluating DRL models.
- **`rl_agents.py`**: Implements various DRL algorithms (e.g., PPO, A2C, SAC) using PyTorch and Stable Baselines3. These agents learn optimal trading policies by interacting with the `trading_environment.py`.
- **`training_pipeline.py`**: Orchestrates the entire DRL model training process, including data loading, environment initialization, agent training, evaluation, and model saving. It integrates with MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.

#### 2.2.4. Strategy Execution Layer
**Purpose**: Translates DRL-generated signals into actual trade orders and manages the trading portfolio.
**Key Components**:
- **`signal_processor.py`**: Receives trading signals from the DRL core (or other strategy modules) and converts them into a standardized format for order execution. It may perform initial checks or transformations on the signals.
- **`order_manager.py`**: Responsible for interacting with LBank's trading API to place, cancel, and query orders. It handles order types (market, limit), order status updates, and ensures reliable communication with the exchange.
- **`portfolio_manager.py`**: Tracks the current state of the trading portfolio, including asset balances, open positions, PnL (Profit and Loss), and overall portfolio value. It provides real-time portfolio snapshots to the risk management layer.

#### 2.2.5. Risk Management & Safety Layer
**Purpose**: Ensures the trading system operates within predefined risk tolerances and implements safety protocols to prevent catastrophic losses.
**Key Components**:
- **`risk_assessor.py`**: Calculates various risk metrics (e.g., VaR, CVaR, Sharpe Ratio, Drawdown, Volatility, Correlation Risk, Liquidity Score) based on the current portfolio and market conditions. It assesses the overall risk level of the portfolio.
- **`safety_protocols.py`**: Implements a multi-tiered system of circuit breakers and automated responses. This includes:
    - **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Adjusts trade quantities based on current risk levels.
    - **Drawdown Limits**: Triggers actions (e.g., position reduction, trading halt) if portfolio drawdown exceeds thresholds.
    - **Volatility Controls**: Restricts trading during periods of extreme market volatility.
    - **Consecutive Loss Tracking**: Monitors losing streaks and can initiate temporary trading halts.
    - **Manual Override**: Provides mechanisms for human intervention.
- **`risk_integration.py`**: Acts as the central hub for risk management. It intercepts trading signals, passes them through the `risk_assessor` and `safety_protocols`, and either approves, modifies, or rejects trades based on the risk assessment. It also performs post-trade analysis to update risk metrics.

#### 2.2.6. MLOps & Monitoring Layer
**Purpose**: Provides capabilities for deploying, monitoring, and managing the lifecycle of DRL models and the overall system.
**Key Components**:
- **`model_deployment.py`**: Handles the deployment of trained DRL models. It supports model versioning (MLflow integration), containerization (Docker), and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalable and reliable model serving.
- **`monitoring_system.py`**: Collects real-time metrics on system health (CPU, memory, network), trading performance (PnL, win rate, trade count), and model performance (inference latency, signal quality). It integrates with alerting mechanisms (email, Slack) to notify operators of anomalies or critical events.
- **`logging_auditing.py`**: Implements a comprehensive logging and auditing system to record all significant system events, trading decisions, and risk actions. This is crucial for debugging, post-mortem analysis, and regulatory compliance.
